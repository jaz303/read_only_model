ReadOnlyModel
=============

Makes ActiveRecord models read-only by rewriting all destructive database operations to raise ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyModel. Great for integration with legacy databases where all the business logic is in a separate codebase.

Installation
------------

script/plugin install git://github.com/jaz303/read_only_model.git

Usage
-----

class MyLegacyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  read_only_model
end
